| 3 | **The Policy-Making Process** {{< br >}}{{< br >}} What are the key features of the federal environmental policy-making process? Is it useful to think about policy-making as a linear process that goes through certain predictable stages? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Discussion question: Does public policy-making follow a predictable process? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _Scenario #2_ {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 4 | **Policy Evaluation** {{< br >}}{{< br >}} How can we tell whether national environmental policies are working? Should state and local environmental policies be evaluated differently from federal policies? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Discussion question: How soon after a policy is adopted can its impact/effectiveness be evaluated? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _Scenario #3_ {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 5 | **Comparative Policy Analysis** {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Do you expect different countries to have different environmental policies? Why? What can a comparative look at environmental policy-making teach us? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Given the substantial differences in the way national governments approach environmental policy and natural resource management, what can we hope to learn from comparative analysis of these policies and approaches? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _Scenario #4_ {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 6 | **A Theory of Environmental Planning and Policy-Making** {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Can there be such a thing? What should we be looking for: a theory of the "problem?" A descriptive or a normative theory of the process by which human and natural systems interact? A prescriptive "theory of environmental planning practice?" {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Discussion question: Why are public policy-makers and environmental managers so unlikely to build explicit adaptive management efforts into the programs and policies for which they are responsible? {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  

Unit 2: Environmental Ethics and the Environmental Policy Debate
----------------------------------------------------------------

| SES # | TOPICS |
| --- | --- |

Unit 3: Environmental Planning Techniques
-----------------------------------------

| SES # | TOPICS |
| --- | --- |
| 11 | **Environmental Analysis: Science, Policy, and Politics in Environmental Decision-Making** {{< br >}}{{< br >}} What model should be used to describe the ideal interaction between science, politics, and policy in a democratic context? What are the tools of environmental analysis that experts have to offer? How should we assess the strengths and weaknesses of these analytic tools? When and how should they be used (and by whom) to produce "better" policy and planning? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Discussion question: Should science trump politics in environmental decision-making? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _Second written assignment due_ {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 12 | **Environmental Impact Assessment** {{< br >}}{{< br >}} What is it? How do you do it? How would we know a good Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) from a bad one? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Discussion question: Is it possible for an Environmental Impact Assessment or a Social Impact Assesment to have a beneficial result (and be worth the cost) if it leads to no changes in the proposed project? Explain. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _Scenario #8_ {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 13 | **Cost-Benefit Analysis** {{< br >}}{{< br >}} What is it? How do you do it?

Unit 4: Public Participation and Collaborative Decision-Making
--------------------------------------------------------------

| SES # | TOPICS |
| --- | --- |
| 19 | **Public Participation and Group Decision-Making** {{< br >}}{{< br >}} How can the basic tenents of democracy be respected while still ensuring "sound" environmental planning? What assumptions should we make about the role that citizens, stakeholders, and the public-at-large ought to play in environmental decision-making? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Discussion question: Can you say in a few sentences what democracy requires by way of public participation in governmental decision-making? {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 20 | **Public Participation Timelines** {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Polling, focus groups, public hearings, advisory committees, and online dialogue. When should they be used and for what purpose? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Discussion question: Why use an independent mediator to help resolve resource allocation conflicts in the public sector? After all, isn't this the responsibility of elected and appointed officials (including courts and judges) to do this? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _Scenario #12_ {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 21 | **Collaborative Decision-Making** {{< br >}}{{< br >}} What part should consensus building and collaboration play in a theory of environmental planning? What are the minimum conditions for effective stakeholder involvement in collaborative decision-making with public agencies? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Discussion question: Consensus building or collaborative planning only matters if it gets "good" results. What are the outcomes you would measure and in a few words, how would you measure them? (Gunston, Day, and Williams use surveys of different stakeholders. Is that sufficient?) {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _Scenario #13_ {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 22 | **Consensus Building and Dispute Resolution** {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Neutrality, advocacy, and the role of the planner. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Discussion question: Why do you think it is so difficult for people with contending views to reach mutually advantageous agreements in public disputes? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _Scenario #14_ {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _Final written assignment due_ {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 23 | **Politics, Power, and Theories of Collective Action** {{< br >}}{{< br >}} In the final analysis, since planning is a political activity and political outcomes are inevitably a product of political power, is it possible for environmental planning to produce decisions that do something other than reflect and reinforce the existing distribution of power? How do theories of collective action (i.e. managing the commons, the failures of market forces to discount future needs properly, the failures of the market to internalize social costs, and the emergence of the public interest) shape environmental policy-making and planning? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Discussion question: Do you think it is important to have a statistically representative sample of citizen reactions to ensure the legitimacy of a public participation effort? {{< br >}}{{< br >}}
